>This project was built with the goal of learning [TypeScript](https://github.com/microsoft/typescript) + [Jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest) + [ExpressJs](https://github.com/expressjs/express). It should be splitted into microservices, but since it will be only for personal use, it's going to be a monolythe. The SelfAPI is a simple RESTful API, which contains a variety of endpoints, and all of them will be consumed by some kind of front-end of mine.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

## Documentation

Please visit [this](https://joaocasarin.herokuapp.com/v1/docs) website to view the full documentation with all the application endpoints.
## Installation

1. Clone this repo on your local machine:

```sh

$ cd selfapi
```

To install and set up the project, run:

```sh

```

Or if you prefer using NPM:

```sh
$ npm install
```

## Usage

### Serving the app

```sh
$ yarn dev
```

### Running the tests

```sh
$ yarn test
```

#### Alternatives

* Enable coverage report
```sh
$ yarn test:cov
```

* Run only UNIT tests WITH coverage report
```sh
$ yarn test:unit
```

* Run only INTEGRATION tests WITH coverage report
```sh
$ yarn test:int
```

### Building a production version

```sh
$ yarn build
```

This command will create a production version of the project
inside your local `dist/` folder

### Serving the production version

```sh
$ yarn start
```

This will use `node` for serving your already
generated production version of the project.

*Note* this requires
[Building a distribution version](#building-a-distribution-version) first.
